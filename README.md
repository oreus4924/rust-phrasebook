# rust-phrasebook
Wouldn't it be super nice for beginners to rust if there were a list of examples of code with English translations?  This project is intended to compile such a list.
When I have the time, I'll be adding examples of varying complexity as issues which anyone can resolve by translating the code into clear English.

Once there is a large pool of translated code snippets, I will rewrite all of the translations for consistency's sake.


*THE END END GOAL*:  A nice program which takes in valid rust code and spits out a clear english translation. (one day...)

*THE END GOAL*:  A full rust phrasebook for beginners like myself to reference when we need help.
  Like any translation phrasebook, there will be various sections with different topics and various permutations of the same things.
  
*FOR NOW*:  Compile as many translations as possible and sort them.
